[B]- Backup your personal data (Important)
- There are GApps and Vanilla builds 
- Download the edition you wish
- Boot to recovery (TWRP recommended).
- Wipe the System, Cache, Data and ART/Dalvik cache.
- Flash the ROM.
- Flash the root solution of your choice (optional).
- Reboot your device.[/B]

[B]The ROM has GApps persistence in between dirty flashes, so you only have to flash them once!
The root solution should be flashed together with every update (= ROM Update)[/B]

[SIZE=3][B]Currently Supported Root Solutions:[/B][/SIZE]

[COLOR="DarkRed"][URL="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases"]Magisk stable[/URL][/COLOR]
Magisk versions higher than 14.0 doesn't require flash on every dirty flash depending on the device, some devices need you to flash it every time, unless your maintainer says otherwise it should be fine
